I am a PhD student in solar astrophysics at the [Sydney Institute for Astronomy](https://sifa.sydney.edu.au/) at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). I work on projects studying the structure of the coronal magnetic field and its influence on solar activity, under the supervision of [Prof. Michael Wheatland](https://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~wheat/).
I am also involved in a project studying the drivers of space weather events through ensemble modelling.  

Previously, I was a research intern at the [Indian Institute of Astrophysics](https://www.iiap.res.in/) with [Prof. S.P Rajaguru](https://www.iiap.res.in/people/profile/academic/s-p-rajaguru/), where I studied plasma flows around emerging solar active regions using *helioseismology*.

I earned my Masters in Physics from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Thiruvananthapuram][https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/], where I worked with [Dr. Nitin Yadav](https://sites.google.com/view/nitinyadav/about-me) studying the formation of solar prominences using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. 

I completed my undergraduate degree at [Azim Premji University](https://azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/) where I worked on my honour's thesis with [Dr. Jayanth Vyasanakere](https://azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/people/jayanth-vyasanakere) studying *n*-body simulations of the solar system.
