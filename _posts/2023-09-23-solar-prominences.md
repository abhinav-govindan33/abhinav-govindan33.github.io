We studied the formation of solar prominences in the coronal region of the Sun through numerical simulations. The code used to perform the simulations is the MPI-Adaptive Mesh Refinement-Versatile Advection Code or MPI-AMRVAC for short. It is an open source code "_aimed at solving (primarily hyperbolic) partial differential equations by a number of different numerical schemes_". MPI-AMRVAC is developed and maintained by an international team led by professor Rony Keppens from Centre for Mathematical Plasma-Astrophysics (CmPA), KU Leuven.
