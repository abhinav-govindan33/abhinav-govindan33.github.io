I am a PhD student at the Sydney Institute for Astronomy in The University of Sydney. I work with Prof. Michael Wheatland on studying magnetic fields in the solar corona using numerical simulations and data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).   

I completed my Masters in Physics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Thiruvananthapuram, where I worked with Dr. Nitin Yadav studying the formation of solar prominences. I completed my undergraduate degree at Azim Premji University, Bangalore, where I worked with Dr. Jayanth Vyasanakere on _n_-body simulations of the solar system. I also worked as a research intern at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore with Prof. S.P Rajaguru, studying plasma flows around emerging solar active regions using helioseismology.
