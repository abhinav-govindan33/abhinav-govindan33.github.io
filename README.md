### Welcome to my personal website!

This is a space where I will be putting up my information, research portfolio and hopefully some posts in the future. Feel free to fork and modify to your liking. This website was created using the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme]([https://link-url-here.org](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and uses the _neon_ skin. Any helpful tips and comments are welcome!
