Hello! I'm Abhinav and I currently work as a research intern in helioseismology at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore under Prof. S.P Rajaguru. I completed my M.Sc Physics degree from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Thiruvananthapuram, where I worked under Dr. Nitin Yadav on the topic of solar prominences. Before that, I completed my B.Sc Physics (Honours) at Azim Premji University, Bangalore and worked on my thesis under Dr. Jayanth Vyasanakere on solar system dynamics and n-body problems. 

I am primarily interested in solar physics, with a broader interest in astrophysics. I have worked on projects involving numerical simulations as well as data analysis using observations. Pursuing a PhD in astrophysics is my future goal and I'm on the lookout for any opportunities.
